## See project wiki

The MOADSD-NG project does provide a simple way to setup a hybrid cloud security demo, playground and learning environment within the clouds or alternatively on a local ESXi (no vCenter required). Core technologies used (besides of Trend Micro solutions) are the cloud native virtualization functionalities, a full-blown Kubernetes cluster with cluster storage and release management tools (Jenkins / GitLab).
Ansible, the de facto most used orchestration tool, is used for the whole life-cycle of your MOADSD-NG environment.
